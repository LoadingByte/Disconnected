/**
 * Vulnerability actions describe what an attacked computer part (e.g. a program) should do.
 * For example, a buffer overflow {@link Vulnerability} could provide actions to crash a program or to execute a payload (e.g. for opening a remote session).
 * On the other hand, an SQL injection vulnerability could be used to access a database.<br>
 * <br>
 * This class stores actions which are assigned to a generated vulnerability.
 * It is independent from the original {@link Action} configuration class.
 * However, it only stores the {@link #ATTACK_WEIGHT} value because the {@code vulnerabilityProbability} is not required anymore after a vulnerability has been generated.<br>
 * <br>
 * When a new {@link Attack} (it might also be an exploit) is "generated" from a vulnerability, the attack weights are used to determine which available action is
 * used as {@link Attack#PREFERRED_ACTION} for the attack.
 * Actions with higher attack weights are more likely to be chosen than actions with lower attack weights.
 * For example, a {@code "crash"} action would usually have a higher attack weight than an {@code "executePayload"} action because it is easier
 * to write an exploit that crashes a program than to write an exploit that executes a binary payload.<br>
 * <br>
 * See {@link Action} for more general information on vulnerability actions.
