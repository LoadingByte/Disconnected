 * A data object that represents a vulnerability a piece of hardware or software, which is related to a computer, may have.

 * For example, a buffer overflow vulnerability can be used to crash a program or to execute a payload (e.g. for opening a remote session).
 * On the other hand, an SQL injection vulnerability can be used to access a database.
